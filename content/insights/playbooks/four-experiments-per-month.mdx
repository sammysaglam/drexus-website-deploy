Teams running fewer than 4 experiments per month learn too slowly to compete. Teams running more
than 8 burn out and ship sloppy tests. After managing 2,000+ experiments across our portfolio, we've
found the sweet spot: 4 experiments monthly, in 2-week cycles. Here's the exact playbook.

## Decision Latency and Opportunity Cost

Every week you don't test is a week you don't learn. We've tracked decision latency across 200+
product teams:

- Average time from idea to test: 6 weeks
- Average time from test to decision: 3 weeks
- Total learning cycle: 9 weeks

At this pace, teams run 5-6 experiments per year. Market leaders run 48+.

The cost compounds:

- Slow teams: 6 learnings/year
- Fast teams: 48 learnings/year
- Learning advantage: 8x

<Callout type="warning" title="The Compounding Learning Gap">
  Teams that run 4x more experiments don't just learn 4x faster - they compound learnings into
  better hypotheses. By year 2, they're running categorically different experiments based on deeper
  insights.
</Callout>

## Two-Week Cycles & Sample-Size Sanity

The biggest experiment killer? Waiting for statistical significance that never comes. Here's our
2-week cycle framework that balances speed with statistical rigor:

### Week 1: Design & Deploy

**Days 1-3: Hypothesis & Design**

- Problem statement (1 sentence)
- Hypothesis (If we X, then Y because Z)
- Success metrics (primary + guardrails)
- Quick mockup or prototype

**Days 4-5: Technical Setup**

- Implement variant(s)
- QA test all paths
- Set up analytics
- Deploy to 10% traffic

### Week 2: Run & Read

**Days 6-12: Active Experiment**

- Monitor daily for errors
- Check sample size progress
- Watch for guardrail metrics
- Document observations

**Days 13-14: Analysis & Decision**

- Statistical significance check
- Practical significance evaluation
- Go/no-go decision
- Next experiment planning

<Step number={1} title="Calculate Required Sample Size">
  Use this quick formula: n = 16 × (σ/δ)² Where σ = standard deviation of your metric and δ =
  minimum detectable effect. For most teams, this means 1,000-5,000 users per variant.
</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Set Traffic Allocation">
  Based on your weekly traffic and required sample size, allocate experiment traffic. If you need
  2,000 users per variant and get 10,000 weekly visitors, run at 40% allocation.
</Step>

<Step number={3} title="Define Stop Conditions">
  If you won't hit sample size in 14 days, either: - Increase traffic allocation - Reduce variants -
  Change success metric - Skip the test (not everything needs testing)
</Step>

## Experiment Backlog Grooming

A healthy experiment backlog fuels consistent velocity. We use the ICE framework with a twist:

**Impact (1-10)**: Potential lift to primary metric **Confidence (1-10)**: Strength of hypothesis
based on data **Effort (1-10)**: Developer days required (inverted - 10 = easy)

**Our twist**: Multiply by Learning Value (1-3)

- 3 = Validates core assumption
- 2 = Optimizes known winner
- 1 = Incremental improvement

  Low impact and confidence. Archived as not worth pursuing.
</Callout>

## Guardrails and Ethics

Speed without safety leads to bad decisions. Every experiment needs guardrails:

### Technical Guardrails

- Error rate &lt;0.1% increase
- Page load &lt;100ms increase
- Crash rate unchanged
- Analytics firing correctly

### Business Guardrails

- Revenue per user ±5%
- Support tickets &lt;20% increase
- Churn rate unchanged
- NPS ±5 points

### Ethical Guardrails

- No dark patterns
- Clear value exchange
- Reversible actions
- Transparent pricing

## Template Walkthrough

Here's the exact template we use for every experiment:

```markdown
## Experiment: [Name]

**Owner**: [PM/Engineer] **Duration**: [Start] - [End] **Traffic**: [X%]

### Problem

[1-2 sentences on what users struggle with]

### Hypothesis

If we [change], Then [metric] will [increase/decrease] by [X%] Because [reasoning based on user
behavior]

### Variants

- Control: [Current state]
- Variant A: [Change description]
- (Variant B: [If multivariate])

### Success Metrics

- Primary: [Single metric + target]
- Guardrails: [3-4 metrics to not harm]

### Results

- Sample size: [Actual N per variant]
- Primary metric: [Lift % + confidence interval]
- Statistical significance: [Yes/No + p-value]
- Decision: [Ship/Iterate/Kill]

### Learnings

[2-3 bullets on what we learned about users]

### Next Steps

[Follow-up experiments or implementation plan]
```

## Real Playbook: B2B SaaS Case Study

Let's walk through a real month of experiments from a portfolio company:

### Week 1-2: Signup Simplification

**Hypothesis**: Reducing signup from 5 fields to 2 will increase completion by 25% **Result**: 31%
increase in signups, shipped to 100% **Learning**: Users will give more info post-signup if value is
clear

### Week 3-4: Onboarding Video

**Hypothesis**: 2-minute video will increase activation by 20% **Result**: 3% increase, not
significant, killed **Learning**: Users want to explore, not watch

### Week 5-6: Trial Extension Offer

**Hypothesis**: Offering 7-day extension will increase conversion 15% **Result**: 22% increase in
conversion, shipped **Learning**: Users need more time to get buy-in

### Week 7-8: Annual Pricing Default

**Hypothesis**: Defaulting to annual will increase revenue per user 30% **Result**: 18% increase in
revenue, 5% decrease in conversions, shipped **Learning**: Trade-off acceptable for unit economics

**Month Summary**: 4 experiments, 3 shipped, 52% revenue increase

## Scaling Your Experiment Velocity

Once you hit 4 experiments monthly, scale carefully:

### Month 1-3: Foundation (4 experiments/month)

- Focus on highest-impact areas
- Build experiment muscle memory
- Establish review rituals
- Document everything

### Month 4-6: Acceleration (6 experiments/month)

- Add dedicated analyst resource
- Build reusable test components
- Automate results dashboards
- Expand to multiple surfaces

### Month 7+: Optimization (8 experiments/month max)

- Dedicated growth team
- Parallel track experiments
- Machine learning for analysis
- Cross-team learning systems
