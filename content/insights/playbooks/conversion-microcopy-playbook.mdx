Small words drive big results. After running 500+ microcopy A/B tests, we've found that changing
just 5-10 words can lift conversion by 20-35%. This playbook contains the exact phrases, patterns,
and principles that consistently win.

## Where Microcopy Matters Most

Not all text deserves optimization. Focus your effort on these high-impact areas where we see the
biggest lifts:

### The Conversion Hot Zones

1. **Form Field Labels** (15-25% impact)
   - What information you're asking for
   - Why you need it
   - How it will be used

2. **Error Messages** (20-30% impact)
   - What went wrong
   - How to fix it
   - Preventing repeated errors

3. **Call-to-Action Buttons** (10-20% impact)
   - What happens when clicked
   - Commitment level
   - Value proposition

4. **Trust & Security Messages** (25-40% impact)
   - Data handling
   - Security assurances
   - Privacy commitments

5. **Progress Indicators** (10-15% impact)
   - Where users are
   - What's coming next
   - How much time remains

<Callout type="success" title="The Microcopy ROI">
  Microcopy changes require zero development time, no design resources, and can be tested
  immediately. It's the highest ROI optimization available.
</Callout>

## Field Hints, Validation, and Error Recovery

The difference between helpful and harmful field hints comes down to timing and tone. Here's what
works:

### Field Hints That Convert

❌ **Password**

```
Password*
```

✅ **Password with Context**

```
Password
8+ characters, include a number
```

❌ **Phone Number**

```
Phone (required)
Invalid format
```

✅ **Phone with Clear Format**

```
Mobile phone (for delivery updates)
Example: (555) 123-4567
✅ Number verified
```

<Step number={1} title="Add Helper Text Before They Type">
  Show format expectations and why you need the information upfront. "Email (for order
  confirmation)" beats "Email*" every time.
</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Validate Inline with Positive Feedback">
  Don't just show errors. Confirm when fields are correctly filled with checkmarks or green
  highlights. Positive reinforcement increases completion.
</Step>

<Step number={3} title="Write Errors That Help, Not Scold">
  Replace "Invalid input" with "That doesn't look quite right. Email should be like:
  name@example.com"
</Step>

### The Error Message Formula

Every error message needs three parts:

1. **What happened** (in human terms)
2. **Why it matters** (impact on user)
3. **How to fix it** (specific action)

<DoDont
  dos={[
    "Email looks incorrect → Should be like: you@example.com",
    "Card was declined → Try another payment method",
    "Password too weak → Add a number and symbol for security",
    "Session expired → Sign in again to keep your data safe",
  ]}
  donts={[
    "ERROR: INVALID_EMAIL_FORMAT",
    "Transaction failed",
    "Password does not meet requirements",
    "401: Unauthorized",
  ]}
/>

## Trust Cues and Security Theater

Users abandon forms when they feel unsafe. These microcopy patterns build trust:

### At Email Collection

❌ "Enter your email" ✅ "Your email (we'll never spam you)"

### At Payment

❌ "Payment information" ✅ "Secure payment - encrypted and safe"

### At Phone Number

❌ "Phone number" ✅ "Phone (only for delivery issues)"

### Trust-Building Phrases That Work

- "No spam, ever. Unsubscribe anytime."
- "Your information is encrypted and secure"
- "We'll only contact you about your order"
- "30-day money-back guarantee"
- "Join 50,000+ happy customers"
- "As seen in [Credible Publication]"

## Psychology Principles Behind Winning Copy

Understanding why certain phrases work helps you create new winners:

### Principle 1: Reduce Cognitive Load

**Bad**: "Enter the email address associated with your account for authentication" **Good**: "Your
email" **Why**: Shorter phrases process faster

### Principle 2: Address Unspoken Concerns

**Bad**: "Phone number" **Good**: "Phone (only if we can't deliver)" **Why**: Acknowledges privacy
worries

### Principle 3: Create Momentum

**Bad**: "Submit" **Good**: "Almost done - complete order" **Why**: Progress creates commitment

### Principle 4: Social Proof

**Bad**: "Subscribe" **Good**: "Join 10,000+ subscribers" **Why**: Others' actions validate decision

### Principle 5: Specific > Vague

**Bad**: "Fast delivery" **Good**: "Arrives by Tuesday, March 5" **Why**: Concrete details build
trust

3. Document current conversion rates
4. Identify biggest drop-off points

### Week 2: Quick Wins

1. Update error messages to helpful format
2. Add trust copy near payment fields
3. Clarify why you need each field
4. Make CTAs specific about outcomes

### Week 3: Test and Measure

2. Build a phrase library
3. Train team on principles
4. Set up regular testing cadence

## Your Microcopy Style Guide

Create consistency with these guidelines:

### Tone

- Helpful, not condescending
- Clear, not clever
- Reassuring, not pushy
- Specific, not vague

### Voice

- Active: "We'll email your receipt"
- Personal: "Your account" not "The account"
- Conversational: "Looks like" not "It appears"
- Confident: "You're all set!" not "Process complete"

### Formatting

- Sentence case for fields
- Title case for buttons
- No periods in field labels
- Use contractions naturally

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Overexplaining** "Your email address will be used to send you a receipt, updates about
your order, and occasional marketing messages which you can unsubscribe from at any time" **Fix**:
"Your email (for receipts and updates)"

**Mistake 2: Being Too Cute** "Oopsie! That didn't work!" **Fix**: "That didn't work - try again"

**Mistake 3: Tech Speak** "Authentication credentials invalid" **Fix**: "Wrong email or password"

**Mistake 4: Passive Aggressive** "You forgot to fill this out" **Fix**: "Please add your email"

## Measuring Microcopy Impact

Track these metrics to prove microcopy ROI:

1. **Field Completion Rate**: % who start and finish each field
2. **Error Rate**: How often each error appears
3. **Error Recovery Rate**: % who fix errors and continue
4. **Time to Complete**: Seconds per form section
5. **Abandon Point**: Where users leave most often

Before/after comparison typically shows:

- 20-30% reduction in errors
- 15-25% faster completion
- 25-40% better error recovery
- 10-35% conversion improvement
