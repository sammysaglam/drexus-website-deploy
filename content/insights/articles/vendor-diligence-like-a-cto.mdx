Half of vendor relationships fail in the first year, but not because of missing features. After
evaluating 200+ vendors for portfolio companies, we've identified the five factors that predict
success or expensive failure. Here's the diligence framework that spots red flags before you sign.

## Common Failure Modes Nobody Talks About

Feature comparisons dominate vendor selection, yet features rarely cause failures. Our data shows
the real killers:

**Bus factor disasters** (35% of failures): Their lead engineer leaves. Response times triple.
Nobody knows your integration. Six months later, you're migrating off their platform.

**SLA reality gaps** (30% of failures): They promise 99.9% uptime. The fine print excludes
"scheduled maintenance" every weekend. Your customers don't care about semantic differences when
they can't log in.

**Scale cliffs** (25% of failures): Works great at 1,000 requests/day. Falls over at 10,000. Their
solution? "Move to Enterprise tier" at 10x the cost. Your growth becomes their leverage.

**Support theater** (10% of failures): 24/7 support means an offshore team that can only reset
passwords. Real issues require "escalation to engineering" with 5-day response times.

<Callout type="warning" title="The Vendor Lock-in Test">
  Before signing, ask: "If we had to migrate off in 6 months, what would it cost?" If they can't
  answer clearly, multiply your estimate by 3. That's your real switching cost.
</Callout>

## SLA Clauses That Matter (And Those That Don't)

Most SLAs are written by lawyers to minimize vendor liability, not ensure your success. Focus on
these five clauses:

### Uptime Definition

**What to look for**: Uptime measured from your perspective **Red flag**: "Uptime excludes scheduled
maintenance" **Better**: "Uptime includes all user-impacting downtime"

### Credit Structure

**What to look for**: Automatic credits, not "upon request" **Red flag**: "5% credit for &lt;99%
uptime" **Better**: "Graduated credits: 10% at 99%, 25% at 95%, 50% at 90%"

### Performance Metrics

**What to look for**: P95 response time commitments **Red flag**: "Average response time &lt;500ms"
**Better**: "95th percentile response time &lt;500ms"

### Support Response

**What to look for**: Severity-based response times **Red flag**: "Best effort support" **Better**:
"Sev 1: 1 hour, Sev 2: 4 hours, Sev 3: 1 business day"

### Data Portability

**What to look for**: Full export in standard formats **Red flag**: "Data available upon written
request" **Better**: "Self-service export of all data within 24 hours"

<DoDont
  dos={[
    "Get SLAs reviewed by an engineer, not just legal",
    "Test their support before you need it",
    "Negotiate credits that matter (&gt;25%)",
    "Include performance, not just uptime",
  ]}
  donts={[
    "Accept 'best effort' anything",
    "Skip reading the exclusions section",
    "Assume Enterprise tier has better SLAs",
    "Forget about data export rights",
  ]}
/>

## Bus Factor & Continuity Planning

The "bus factor" - how many people need to be hit by a bus before you're screwed - predicts vendor
stability better than revenue metrics.

<Step number={1} title="Map Critical Knowledge">
  During diligence, identify who knows: - Your integration details - Your custom configurations -
  Your escalation path - Your technical architecture
</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Test the Bench">
  Request a technical call without their lead salesperson/engineer. If it's a disaster, that's your
  future support experience.
</Step>

<Step number={3} title="Document Everything">
  If their documentation is "coming soon" or "available after purchase," run. Well-documented
  vendors have 73% higher success rates in our data.
</Step>

### Bus Factor Scorecard

Rate each factor 0-2 points:

- Multiple people know your account: 0-2 points
- Documentation publicly available: 0-2 points
- Support team &gt;5 people: 0-2 points
- Been in business &gt;3 years: 0-2 points
- Engineering team &gt;10 people: 0-2 points

**Score interpretation**:

- 8-10: Low bus factor risk
- 5-7: Moderate risk, negotiate protections
- 0-4: High risk, consider alternatives

## Observability and Friday Receipts

The best vendors provide transparency without you asking. We call it the "Friday Receipt Test":

Can they send you weekly:

- Uptime percentage for your services
- P95 response times
- Error rates by endpoint
- Ticket response times
- Upcoming changes that might impact you

Vendors who can't provide this data aren't measuring it. Vendors who aren't measuring it can't
improve it.

## Pilot Rubric with Exit Criteria

Never go straight to annual contracts. Our pilot framework de-risks vendor relationships:

### 30-Day Pilot Structure

**Week 1**: Basic integration

- Can you connect successfully?
- Does authentication work?
- Is documentation accurate?

**Week 2-3**: Real usage

- Deploy actual use case
- Measure performance
- Test support responsiveness

**Week 4**: Scale test

- 10x your expected load
- Break things on purpose
- Measure recovery time

### Exit Criteria (Define Before Starting)

Clear exit criteria prevent awkward "it's not working out" conversations:

1. **Performance**: P95 latency &gt;2x promised
2. **Reliability**: &gt;2 severity-1 incidents
3. **Support**: &gt;24hr response on critical issues
4. **Scale**: Degradation at &lt;5x current load
5. **Cost**: Actual usage &gt;30% above quoted

### Vendor Evaluation Framework

<Callout type="success" title="Technical Fit (25% weight)">
  **Scoring Criteria:** Solves core problem, API quality, documentation

  **Red Flags:** "Roadmap" features, poor documentation

  The most critical factor - does the solution actually solve your problem with quality implementation?
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Reliability (20% weight)">
  **Scoring Criteria:** Uptime history, architecture, redundancy

  **Red Flags:** &lt;99.5% historical uptime, single region deployment

  Can you depend on this vendor for mission-critical operations?
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Support (20% weight)">
  **Scoring Criteria:** Response times, expertise, escalation paths

  **Red Flags:** Offshore-only support, no escalation path

  When things go wrong, will you get the help you need quickly?
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Commercial (15% weight)">
  **Scoring Criteria:** Pricing model, contract flexibility

  **Red Flags:** Lock-in terms, usage penalties

  Is the commercial model sustainable and flexible for your growth?
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Company (10% weight)">
  **Scoring Criteria:** Stability, references, bus factor

  **Red Flags:** &lt;2 years old, &lt;10 employees

  Is this a stable company that will be around long-term?
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Scale (10% weight)">
  **Scoring Criteria:** Growth alignment, performance

  **Red Flags:** No enterprise customers

  Can they grow with you and handle your future needs?
</Callout>

**Total Score Interpretation**:

- > 80: Strong proceed signal
- 60-80: Proceed with specific protections
- &lt;60: Find alternatives

## Real Vendor Evaluation Example

Let's walk through a recent evaluation:

**Vendor**: Authentication-as-a-Service startup **Initial appeal**: 50% cheaper than Auth0 **Our
evaluation**:

1. **Bus Factor Test**: Failed - 3 person team, lead engineer owns all knowledge
2. **SLA Review**: No performance SLAs, only uptime
3. **Pilot Results**: 3 outages in 30 days
4. **Support Test**: 48-hour response to critical issue
5. **Scale Test**: Performance degraded at 2x load

**Decision**: Passed despite price advantage **Result**: Competitor who chose them spent 4 months
migrating after repeated outages

## Negotiation Leverage Points

Once you've scored a vendor, use these leverage points:

**If they score 60-70**:

- Demand monthly contracts until proven
- Require performance bonds for SLA misses
- Negotiate 30-day termination rights
- Get executive escalation paths

**If they score 70-80**:

- Push for better credit terms
- Lock in pricing for 24 months
- Add data export guarantees
- Include migration assistance clause

**If they score 80+**:

- Focus on growth pricing protections
- Negotiate volume discounts early
- Consider longer-term commitments
- Build strategic partnership terms
