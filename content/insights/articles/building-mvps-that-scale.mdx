Building an MVP is a delicate balance. Move too fast, and you create technical debt that will haunt
you. Move too slowly, and you miss your market window. After helping launch over 100 MVPs, we've
learned what separates the ones that scale from the ones that need complete rewrites.

## The MVP Scaling Paradox

<Callout type="info">
  The goal isn't to build for scale from day one—it's to avoid decisions that make scaling
  impossible later.
</Callout>

Most founders face a cruel irony: the practices that help you move fast initially are often the same
ones that slow you down later. But this doesn't have to be your fate.

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Database Design

<DoDont
  dos={[
    "Use proper indexes from the start",
    "Design with relationships in mind",
    "Plan for data migrations",
    "Use UUID instead of auto-increment IDs",
  ]}
  donts={[
    "Store everything in JSON blobs",
    "Ignore foreign key constraints",
    "Use the database as a queue",
    "Skip backup strategies",
  ]}
/>

Your database is the foundation of your application. While you can refactor code relatively easily,
database migrations at scale are painful and risky.

### API Architecture

<Step number={1} title="Start with REST">
  REST is simple, well-understood, and tooling is excellent. You can always add GraphQL later if
  needed.
</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Version from Day One">
  Include versioning in your API design from the start. Use URL versioning (v1, v2) for clarity.
</Step>

<Step number={3} title="Design for Mobile">
  Even if you're starting web-only, design your APIs as if a mobile app will consume them tomorrow.
</Step>

## Performance Considerations

<ProsCons
  pros={[
    "Caching layer (Redis) from the start",
    "CDN for all static assets",
    "Database query optimization",
    "Horizontal scaling design",
  ]}
  cons={[
    "Premature microservices",
    "Complex orchestration tools",
    "Multi-region deployment initially",
    "Custom frameworks",
  ]}
/>

## Real-World Example

<Quote author="Mike Thompson" role="CTO, ScaleFlow">
  We spent 2 weeks setting up proper CI/CD and monitoring instead of rushing features. That
  investment paid off 100x when we hit our first 10k users and could diagnose issues in minutes
  instead of hours.
</Quote>

## Monitoring & Observability

    { text: "Error tracking (Sentry or similar)", checked: true },
    { text: "Basic APM (Application Performance Monitoring)", checked: true },
    { text: "Uptime monitoring", checked: true },
    { text: "Database slow query logs", checked: true },
    { text: "User analytics", checked: false },
    { text: "Custom business metrics", checked: false },
  ]}
/>

## The 90-Day Scaling Checklist

<Figure

  caption="Typical scaling milestones for a successful MVP"
/>

As you approach your first 1,000 users, these become critical:

1. **Database optimization**: Indexes, query optimization, connection pooling
2. **Caching strategy**: Redis for sessions, computed values, and frequent queries
3. **Background jobs**: Move heavy processing off the request cycle
4. **CDN implementation**: Serve static assets from edge locations
5. **Monitoring upgrade**: Add custom metrics and alerting

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### The "We'll Fix It Later" Trap

<Aside type="warning">
  Technical debt compounds faster than credit card debt. What seems like a minor shortcut today
  becomes a major roadblock at scale.
</Aside>

We've seen teams spend 6 months refactoring what would have taken 2 weeks to build properly
initially. Common examples:

- Hardcoded configuration values
- No separation between environments
- Missing database indexes
- Synchronous processing of everything

### Over-Engineering Early

Equally dangerous is building for problems you don't have:

- Kubernetes for a single-server app
- Microservices before product-market fit
- Complex event sourcing for simple CRUD
- Multi-region deployment for local market

Building an MVP that scales isn't about predicting the future—it's about not painting yourself into
corners. Focus on solid fundamentals, monitor everything, and be prepared to iterate quickly.

Remember: the best architecture is the one that lets you move fast today while keeping doors open
for tomorrow.
