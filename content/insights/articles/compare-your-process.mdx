Teams using the Drexus Way ship 4x more features with half the drama. After analyzing 500+ team
workflows, we've identified the five process gaps that separate fast teams from frustrated ones.
Here's how to spot and fix them.

## What 'Drexus Way' Actually Means

The Drexus Way isn't about following rigid rules - it's about consistent rhythms that compound into
velocity. Three core principles drive everything:

**Cadence Over Perfection**: Regular delivery beats sporadic excellence. Weekly demos beat quarterly
surprises. Daily standups beat ad-hoc check-ins.

**Cut-Lines Over Compromise**: Clear decisions about what's in and what's out. No "we'll see how it
goes." No "if we have time." Binary clarity.

**Receipts Over Meetings**: Written artifacts beat verbal updates. Friday progress emails beat
Monday status meetings. Documented decisions beat remembered conversations.

<Callout type="info" title="The Compound Effect">
  Teams that adopt all three principles don't just ship 3x more - they ship 4x more. The principles
  multiply, not add. Cadence × Cut-lines × Receipts = Exponential improvement.
</Callout>

## Self-Assessment: Rate Your Current State

Score yourself honestly on each dimension (1-5 scale):

### Planning Predictability

How often do your sprints ship what was planned?

- 5: 90%+ stories completed as planned
- 4: 75-90% completion rate
- 3: 50-75% completion rate
- 2: 25-50% completion rate
- 1: <25% or don't track

### Decision Velocity

How long from idea to decision?

- 5: &lt;1 week for most decisions
- 4: 1-2 weeks typical
- 3: 2-4 weeks typical
- 2: 1-2 months typical
- 1: >2 months or decisions revisited

### Feedback Loops

How quickly do you learn from users?

- 5: Daily user feedback
- 4: Weekly user feedback
- 3: Sprint-ly feedback
- 2: Monthly feedback
- 1: Quarterly or less

### Process Clarity

Does everyone know the process?

- 5: Written, followed, improved regularly
- 4: Written and mostly followed
- 3: Known but not written
- 2: Varies by team/project
- 1: No consistent process

### Delivery Rhythm

How predictable is your shipping?

- 5: Ship every week like clockwork
- 4: Ship every sprint reliably
- 3: Ship monthly with some delays
- 2: Ship quarterly, often late
- 1: Ship "when it's ready"

<Step number={1} title="Calculate Your Score">
  Add up your ratings. Total: ___/25 - 20-25: You're already using most Drexus principles - 15-19:
  Clear gaps but strong foundation - 10-14: Significant opportunity for improvement - &lt;10: Start
  with one principle at a time
</Step>

**Your Quick Win**: Cut your next feature scope by 50%. Ship this week instead of next month.
Momentum beats perfection.

### For Ops (Focus: Metrics)

[conversion tracking](/insights/articles/conversion-triage-before-rebuild) **If Process <3**:
Document one workflow per week **If Rhythm <3**: Create deployment schedule

**Your Quick Win**: Pick one metric. Measure it daily. Share it weekly. Make it visible to everyone.

### For Product (Focus: Learning)

**If Planning <3**: Write
[better acceptance criteria](/insights/articles/acceptance-criteria-prevent-rework) **If Feedback
<3**: Start [4 experiments monthly](/insights/playbooks/four-experiments-per-month) **If Decisions
<3**: Implement ICE scoring

**Your Quick Win**: Talk to 5 users this week. Document patterns. Share with team. Repeat weekly.

### For Product-Lead (Focus: Strategy)

**If Predictability <3**: Implement [risk ledgers](/insights/articles/delivery-risk-ledger) **If
Process <3**: Define clear escalation paths **If Rhythm <3**: Set quarterly planning cadence

**Your Quick Win**: Block 2 hours weekly for process improvement. Treat it like a customer meeting.

### For CTO (Focus: Systems)

**If Delivery <3**: Implement [progressive rollouts](/insights/articles/reduce-deployment-downtime)
**If Quality <3**: Add [latency budgets](/insights/benchmarks/latency-budgets-that-stick) **If
Vendors <3**: Run [2-week pilots](/insights/articles/two-week-pilot-prove-fit)

**Your Quick Win**: Automate one manual process this week. Measure time saved. Reinvest in next
automation.

## The 5 Universal Process Gaps

Across all roles and companies, these five gaps slow everyone:

### Gap 1: The Planning Theater

**Symptom**: Elaborate planning that ignores reality **Fix**: Smaller batches, shorter cycles
**First Step**: Cut next sprint scope by 30%

### Gap 2: The Decision Bottleneck

**Symptom**: Waiting for perfect information **Fix**: Time-boxed decisions with clear owners **First
Step**: Set 48-hour decision SLA

### Gap 3: The Feedback Desert

**Symptom**: Building in isolation from users **Fix**: Weekly user contact for all roles **First
Step**: Schedule 5 user calls now

### Gap 4: The Process Mystery

**Symptom**: "How do we do X again?" **Fix**: Written processes with clear owners **First Step**:
Document your worst process

### Gap 5: The Random Release

**Symptom**: Shipping when "ready" **Fix**: Fixed cadence regardless of scope **First Step**: Pick a
ship day, keep it sacred

- Week 2: Document the process
- Week 3: Track adherence
- Week 4: Refine based on feedback

### Month 2: Add Clarity

- Week 5-6: Implement scope cut-lines

## Real Team Transformations

### Team Alpha: From Chaos to Clockwork

**Before**: 2-3 features per quarter, constant firefighting **Gap**: No consistent process (scored
8/25) **Fix**: Started with daily standups, then weekly demos **After**: 8-10 features per quarter,
predictable delivery **Key**: "Rhythm created momentum we never had"

### Team Beta: From Slow to Swift

**Before**: 6-month release cycles, frequent scope creep **Gap**: No cut-lines (scored 12/25)
**Fix**: Ruthless scope cutting, 2-week sprints **After**: Monthly releases, clear roadmap **Key**:
"Saying no to good ideas unlocked great execution"

### Team Gamma: From Guessing to Knowing

**Before**: Building features nobody used **Gap**: No user feedback (scored 14/25) **Fix**: Weekly
user interviews, monthly surveys **After**: 73% feature adoption rate **Key**: "Users tell us what
to build now"

## Common Objections and Answers

**"We're too small for process"** Process enables speed, not slows it. Start with one ritual.

**"Our work doesn't fit sprints"** Use cycles that match your work. The rhythm matters, not the
duration.

**"We're already agile"** Agile is principles, not practices. Most "agile" teams aren't.

**"This seems rigid"** Constraints enable creativity. Jazz has structure too.

## Commit to One Improvement This Week

Don't wait for perfect conditions. Pick one gap and one fix:

<Step number={1} title="Pick Your Gap">
  Look at your lowest score. That's your starting point. Don't overthink it.
</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Choose Your Fix">
  Select the quick win for your role above. Implement this week, not next quarter.
</Step>

<Step number={3} title="Track Your Progress">
  Measure one thing: features shipped, decisions made, user feedback collected. Whatever matches
  your gap.
</Step>
