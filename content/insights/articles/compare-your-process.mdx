# Compare Your Process to the Drexus Way

Spot 5 gaps that slow shipping and how to close them. Take our diagnostic to see how your development process stacks up against teams shipping 4x faster.

This is a test paragraph to see if basic content renders.

## What 'Drexus Way' Actually Means

The Drexus Way isn't about following rigid rules - it's about consistent rhythms that compound into velocity. Three core principles drive everything:

**Cadence Over Perfection**: Regular delivery beats sporadic excellence. Weekly demos beat quarterly surprises. Daily standups beat ad-hoc check-ins.

**Cut-Lines Over Compromise**: Clear decisions about what's in and what's out. No "we'll see how it goes." No "if we have time." Binary clarity.

**Receipts Over Meetings**: Written artifacts beat verbal updates. Friday progress emails beat Monday status meetings. Documented decisions beat remembered conversations.

> **The Compound Effect**
>
> Teams that adopt all three principles don't just ship 3x more - they ship 4x more. The principles multiply, not add. Cadence × Cut-lines × Receipts = Exponential improvement.

## Self-Assessment: Rate Your Current State

Score yourself honestly on each dimension (1-5 scale):

### Planning Predictability

How often do your sprints ship what was planned?

- 5: 90%+ stories completed as planned
- 4: 75-90% completion rate
- 3: 50-75% completion rate
- 2: 25-50% completion rate
- 1: under 25% or don't track

### Decision Velocity

How long from idea to decision?

- 5: under 1 week for most decisions
- 4: 1-2 weeks typical
- 3: 2-4 weeks typical
- 2: 1-2 months typical
- 1: over 2 months or decisions revisited
### Feedback Loops

How quickly do you learn from users?

- 5: Daily user feedback
- 4: Weekly user feedback
- 3: Sprint-ly feedback
- 2: Monthly feedback
- 1: Quarterly or less

### Process Clarity

Does everyone know the process?

- 5: Written, followed, improved regularly
- 4: Written and mostly followed
- 3: Known but not written
- 2: Varies by team/project
- 1: No consistent process

### Delivery Rhythm

How predictable is your shipping?

- 5: Ship every week like clockwork
- 4: Ship every sprint reliably
- 3: Ship monthly with some delays
- 2: Ship quarterly, often late
- 1: Ship "when it's ready"
**Calculate Your Score**: Add up your ratings. Total: ___/25
- 20-25: You're already using most Drexus principles
- 15-19: Clear gaps but strong foundation
- 10-14: Significant opportunity for improvement
- under 10: Start with one principle at a time

## Quick Wins by Role

Based on your score and role, here's where to start:

### For Founders (Focus: Speed)

**If Planning under 3**: Implement MVP scope 1-pagers
**If Decisions under 3**: Create 24-hour decision SLA
**If Delivery under 3**: Start weekly demo days

**Your Quick Win**: Cut your next feature scope by 50%. Ship this week instead of next month. Momentum beats perfection.

### For Ops (Focus: Metrics)

**If Feedback under 3**: Implement conversion tracking
**If Process under 3**: Document one workflow per week
**If Rhythm under 3**: Create deployment schedule

**Your Quick Win**: Pick one metric. Measure it daily. Share it weekly. Make it visible to everyone.

### For Product (Focus: Learning)

**If Planning under 3**: Write better acceptance criteria
**If Feedback under 3**: Start 4 experiments monthly
**If Decisions under 3**: Implement ICE scoring

**Your Quick Win**: Talk to 5 users this week. Document patterns. Share with team. Repeat weekly.

### For Product-Lead (Focus: Strategy)

**If Predictability under 3**: Implement risk ledgers
**If Process under 3**: Define clear escalation paths
**If Rhythm under 3**: Set quarterly planning cadence

**Your Quick Win**: Block 2 hours weekly for process improvement. Treat it like a customer meeting.

### For CTO (Focus: Systems)

**If Delivery under 3**: Implement progressive rollouts
**If Quality under 3**: Add latency budgets
**If Vendors under 3**: Run 2-week pilots

**Your Quick Win**: Automate one manual process this week. Measure time saved. Reinvest in next automation.

## The 5 Universal Process Gaps

Across all roles and companies, these five gaps slow everyone:

### Gap 1: The Planning Theater

**Symptom**: Elaborate planning that ignores reality
**Fix**: Smaller batches, shorter cycles
**First Step**: Cut next sprint scope by 30%

### Gap 2: The Decision Bottleneck

**Symptom**: Waiting for perfect information
**Fix**: Time-boxed decisions with clear owners
**First Step**: Set 48-hour decision SLA

### Gap 3: The Feedback Desert

**Symptom**: Building in isolation from users
**Fix**: Weekly user contact for all roles
**First Step**: Schedule 5 user calls now

### Gap 4: The Process Mystery

**Symptom**: "How do we do X again?"
**Fix**: Written processes with clear owners
**First Step**: Document your worst process

### Gap 5: The Random Release

**Symptom**: Shipping when "ready"
**Fix**: Fixed cadence regardless of scope
**First Step**: Pick a ship day, keep it sacred

## Your Improvement Roadmap

Based on 100+ team transformations, here's the proven sequence:

### Month 1: Establish Rhythm

- Week 1: Pick one cadence (daily standup, weekly demo, etc.)
- Week 2: Document the process
- Week 3: Track adherence
- Week 4: Refine based on feedback

### Month 2: Add Clarity

- Week 5-6: Implement scope cut-lines
- Week 7-8: Create decision templates

### Month 3: Close Loops

- Week 9-10: Add user feedback rhythm
- Week 11-12: Implement progress receipts

### Month 4+: Compound Gains

- Combine all three principles
- Measure velocity improvement
- Share success patterns
- Help other teams adopt

## Real Team Transformations

### Team Alpha: From Chaos to Clockwork

**Before**: 2-3 features per quarter, constant firefighting
**Gap**: No consistent process (scored 8/25)
**Fix**: Started with daily standups, then weekly demos
**After**: 8-10 features per quarter, predictable delivery
**Key**: "Rhythm created momentum we never had"

### Team Beta: From Slow to Swift

**Before**: 6-month release cycles, frequent scope creep
**Gap**: No cut-lines (scored 12/25)
**Fix**: Ruthless scope cutting, 2-week sprints
**After**: Monthly releases, clear roadmap
**Key**: "Saying no to good ideas unlocked great execution"

### Team Gamma: From Guessing to Knowing

**Before**: Building features nobody used
**Gap**: No user feedback (scored 14/25)
**Fix**: Weekly user interviews, monthly surveys
**After**: 73% feature adoption rate
**Key**: "Users tell us what to build now"

## Common Objections and Answers

**"We're too small for process"** Process enables speed, not slows it. Start with one ritual.

**"Our work doesn't fit sprints"** Use cycles that match your work. The rhythm matters, not the duration.

**"We're already agile"** Agile is principles, not practices. Most "agile" teams aren't.

**"This seems rigid"** Constraints enable creativity. Jazz has structure too.

## Commit to One Improvement This Week

Don't wait for perfect conditions. Pick one gap and one fix:

1. **Pick Your Gap**: Look at your lowest score. That's your starting point. Don't overthink it.

2. **Choose Your Fix**: Select the quick win for your role above. Implement this week, not next quarter.

3. **Track Your Progress**: Measure one thing: features shipped, decisions made, user feedback collected. Whatever matches your gap.
