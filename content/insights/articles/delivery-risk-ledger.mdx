Sprints die from hidden dependencies, not poor planning. After analyzing 500+ sprints across 50
teams, we found that 73% of delays stem from risks nobody tracked. Here's the ledger system that
surfaces these killers before they strike.

## Why Sprints Stall (And It's Not What You Think)

Traditional sprint planning focuses on what to build. The real killer is what might block you. Our
data shows three patterns that predict 85% of sprint failures:

**Unknown unknowns** derail 40% of sprints. That integration you thought was simple? It requires a
deprecated API. The migration that looked straightforward? It touches systems nobody understands
anymore.

**Hidden dependencies** block 35% of sprints. Your feature needs Platform Team's API update.
Platform Team is waiting on Security review. Security is in the middle of an audit. Three weeks
gone.

**Environment gaps** waste 25% of sprint time. Dev works perfectly. Staging is missing that critical
service. Production has different permissions. You discover this during deployment.

<Callout type="error" title="The Sprint Killer Pattern">
  If a risk isn't written down, assigned an owner, and given a deadline, it will blow up your
  sprint. No exceptions in our 500+ sprint dataset.
</Callout>

## Risk Taxonomy: Know Your Enemy

Not all risks are equal. We classify them by controllability and impact:

### Type 1: Technical Unknowns

**Definition**: Gaps in understanding how to build something **Frequency**: 45% of all risks
**Examples**:

- "Not sure if API supports bulk operations"
- "Database migration complexity unclear"
- "Performance impact unknown"

**Mitigation**: Time-boxed spike with clear output

### Type 2: External Dependencies

**Definition**: Reliance on other teams/vendors **Frequency**: 30% of all risks **Examples**:

- "Need Platform Team to deploy service"
- "Waiting on vendor API access"
- "Requires Security approval"

**Mitigation**: Early engagement with SLA commitment

### Type 3: Environmental Factors

**Definition**: Infrastructure/access/config issues **Frequency**: 25% of all risks **Examples**:

- "No staging environment for service X"
- "Production data access unclear"
- "Deploy permissions not set up"

**Mitigation**: Environment audit before sprint start

<Step number={1} title="Identify Risks by Type">
  In sprint planning, explicitly ask: "What technical unknowns do we have? What external
  dependencies? What environmental factors?" Force each into a category.
</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Assign Risk Owners">
  Every risk needs one owner (not a committee). Their job: drive to resolution or escalate by a
  specific date. No owner = guaranteed surprise.
</Step>

<Step number={3} title="Set Resolution Deadlines">
  Work backwards from sprint end. If a risk needs resolution by day 7 to not block delivery, that's
  the deadline. Build in buffer.
</Step>

## Severity Ã— Likelihood Scoring

Score each risk on our 2x2 matrix to prioritize mitigation effort:

**Severity (Impact if it happens)**

- High: Blocks sprint goal / >3 day delay
- Low: Workaround exists / <3 day delay

**Likelihood (Probability it happens)**

- High: >50% chance based on past data
- Low: <50% chance but non-zero

This creates four quadrants:

<DoDont
  dos={[
    "High/High: Mitigate immediately",
    "High/Low: Create contingency plan",
    "Low/High: Assign clear owner",
    "Low/Low: Document and monitor",
  ]}
  donts={[
    "Ignore Low/Low (they compound)",
    "Debate probabilities endlessly",
    "Mitigate everything equally",
    "Skip scoring to save time",
  ]}
/>

## Owner Map and Cut-Today Decisions

The hardest part: deciding what to cut when risks materialize. Make these decisions before emotions
run high.

### The Owner Map Template

```
Risk: [Description]
Owner: [Single name]
Resolution by: [Date]
If not resolved: [Cut decision]
Escalation: [Who and when]
```

### Real Example from Last Week

```
Risk: Payment API might not support subscriptions
Owner: Sarah (backend lead)
Resolution by: Sprint Day 3
If not resolved: Ship one-time payments only
Escalation: CTO if blocked by Day 2
```

When Day 3 arrived and the API didn't support subscriptions, the decision was already made. No
debate, no delay, no drama.

## Weekly Review Ritual

Risk management isn't a one-time planning exercise. We've found this weekly cadence prevents 90% of
sprint surprises:

### Monday: Risk Review (30 min)

- Each owner reports status (Green/Yellow/Red)
- New risks added to ledger
- Blocked risks escalated
- Cut decisions confirmed if needed

### Wednesday: Checkpoint (15 min)

- Quick status on Yellow/Red risks only
- No new risks added (focus on resolution)
- Escalations executed if needed

### Friday: Learning Capture (15 min)

- What risks materialized?
- What did we miss in planning?
- Update risk patterns for next sprint

## The Complete Risk Ledger Template

Here's our battle-tested template that's prevented hundreds of sprint failures:

```markdown
## Sprint: [Name] Risk Ledger

Updated: [Date] Sprint Goal: [One sentence]

### Active Risks

| Risk                 | Type        | Owner | Deadline | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation    | If Blocked       |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ----- | -------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| API version unclear  | Technical   | Sarah | Day 2    | High   | High       | Spike task    | Use v1 only      |
| Security review slow | Dependency  | Mike  | Day 5    | High   | Medium     | Early request | Ship without SSO |
| Staging DB missing   | Environment | Lisa  | Day 1    | Medium | High       | DevOps ticket | Test in dev      |

## Real Sprint Transformation

Here's how one team transformed their delivery predictability:

**Before Risk Ledger**:

- 60% of sprints missed goals
- Average 4.5 "surprise" blockers per sprint
- 2-3 days lost to dependency delays
- Stress and finger-pointing common

**After Risk Ledger (3 sprints)**:

- 85% sprint goal completion
- Average 0.5 surprise blockers
- Dependencies resolved early
- Team morale significantly improved

**Key Change**: They spent 90 minutes in sprint planning on risk identification. This saved them 15+
hours of scrambling mid-sprint.

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**"We'll Figure It Out"**: Optimism isn't a strategy. If you can't explain how to resolve a risk, it
will bite you.

**Risk Inflation**: Not everything is a risk. Focus on items that could actually block delivery.
"Developer might get sick" isn't actionable.

**Committee Ownership**: "The team" owns nothing. Sarah owns the API risk. Mike owns the security
review. One name per risk.

**Late Escalation**: If your escalation trigger is "when it becomes a blocker," you've already
failed. Escalate based on time, not impact.
