Founders lose an average of 12 weeks and $180K building features nobody asked for. After helping
200+ teams ship their first version, we've identified the pattern: over-scoping kills more startups
than competition. Here's the 1-page framework that keeps you honest about what actually matters.

## Why Founders Over-Scope (And How It Kills Runway)

We see three consistent triggers that drive scope creep before launch:

**Investor pressure** creates feature inflation. When VCs ask "what about X competitor's feature?"
founders reflexively add it to the roadmap. This defensive building burns 3-4 months of runway on
average.

**Perfectionism masquerading as quality** delays launches by 60%. Teams convince themselves that
users won't tolerate any rough edges, ignoring that early adopters actually prefer speed over
polish.

**Fear of missing the "big vision"** leads to platform thinking before product-market fit. We've
watched teams build multi-tenant architectures for their first 10 customers, burning 6 months on
infrastructure that could wait.

<Callout type="warning" title="The 90-Day Rule">
  If your MVP takes longer than 90 days to ship, you're not building an MVP. You're building V2
  without the learnings from V1.
</Callout>

## The One Activation Path Rule

Every successful MVP follows a simple principle: optimize for one complete user journey. Not two
paths for different personas. Not three ways to accomplish the same goal. One path that delivers
your core value proposition.

Here's how to identify your One Path:

1. **Start with the promise**: What specific outcome do users hire you for?
2. **Map the minimum steps**: What's the shortest path to that outcome?
3. **Cut everything else**: Every feature that doesn't directly enable those steps

We typically see teams cut 70% of planned features using this filter. The remaining 30% ships 4x
faster because there's no feature interdependence to manage.

<Step number={1} title="Define Your Activation Moment">
  Write one sentence: "Users experience value when they ___." This becomes your north star.
  Everything before this moment is required. Everything after is V2.
</Step>

<Step number={2} title="List Required Capabilities">
  For each step in the user journey, list only capabilities that block progress. Authentication?
  Required. User profiles? Usually not. Be ruthless.
</Step>

<Step number={3} title="Set Feature Fences">
  Document what you're explicitly NOT building. This list is as important as your roadmap. It
  prevents scope creep during development.
</Step>

## Must-Have vs. Cut-Line Features

Teams struggle to distinguish between critical and nice-to-have features. Use this scoring framework
based on 200+ successful launches:

**Must-Have Features (Ship in V1)**

- Directly enables the One Activation Path
- Blocks user value if missing
- Takes &lt;1 week to implement
- No acceptable workaround exists

**Cut-Line Features (Defer to V2)**

- Enhances but doesn't enable core value
- Has a manual workaround
- Requires &gt;1 week or new architecture
- Serves &lt;20% of target users

<Checklist
  title="MVP Feature Audit"
  items={[
    { text: "Core value path works end-to-end", checked: true },
    { text: "Each feature has <5 day implementation", checked: true },
    { text: "No features serve future/edge cases", checked: true },
    { text: "Authentication covers only primary flow", checked: false },
    { text: "Monitoring captures activation metrics", checked: false },
    { text: "Error states handle 80% cases only", checked: false },
  ]}
/>

## Acceptance Criteria by Feature Slice

Prevent rework by defining "done" before coding starts. We use a three-tier acceptance model that's
shipped 200+ MVPs on schedule:

### Tier 1: Functional (Does it work?)

- Happy path completes without errors
- Data persists correctly
- Basic validation prevents corruption

### Tier 2: Usable (Can users figure it out?)

- UI provides clear next actions
- Error messages guide recovery
- Loading states prevent confusion

### Tier 3: Measurable (Can we learn?)

- Key actions emit analytics events
- Conversion funnel is trackable
- User feedback mechanism exists

Most teams over-invest in Tier 2 and under-invest in Tier 3. For MVPs, flip this: basic usability
with excellent instrumentation beats polished UI with no data.

## Friday Progress Receipts

Accountability drives velocity. Every Friday, send stakeholders a one-page receipt showing:

1. **Features shipped this week** (with screenshots)
2. **Blockers encountered** (with resolution paths)
3. **Next week's commitments** (specific and measurable)
4. **Burn rate vs. progress** (days remaining)

Teams using Friday receipts ship 40% faster than those with traditional status meetings. The written
format forces clarity and creates a searchable record of decisions.

<ProsCons
  pros={[
    "Creates accountability without micromanagement",
    "Documents decisions for future reference",
    "Surfaces blockers before they compound",
    "Builds stakeholder confidence through transparency",
  ]}
  cons={[
    "Requires 30-60 minutes weekly to compile",
    "Can feel redundant with other reporting",
    "Needs discipline to maintain consistency",
    "Some stakeholders prefer meetings to reading",
  ]}
/>

## Template + Real Example

Here's the exact 1-pager format we use with portfolio companies:

```
MVP SCOPE: [Product Name]
Target Ship: [Date - max 90 days out]
One Path: [User achieves X by doing Y]

MUST SHIP (Week 1-4):
□ Feature A - enables core path step 1
□ Feature B - enables core path step 2
□ Feature C - captures success metrics

CUT LINE (Explicitly Not Building):
✗ Feature X - nice but not critical
✗ Feature Y - <20% of users need this
✗ Feature Z - requires new architecture

SUCCESS METRICS:
- 10 users complete activation path
- 50% day-1 retention
- 1 user requests Feature X or Y

WEEKLY ACCOUNTABILITY:
- Friday receipts to: [stakeholder emails]
- Ship decision by: [date]
- Pivot decision by: [date + 30 days]
```

## Real Example: TaskFlow MVP

A recent portfolio company used this framework to ship their project management tool in 6 weeks
instead of the planned 6 months:

**Original Scope**: 47 features including Gantt charts, resource planning, time tracking, invoicing,
and team chat.

**One Path Focus**: "Users organize work when they create a project and see tasks move through
columns."

**Final MVP**: 12 features - create projects, add tasks, drag between columns, assign people, due
dates, and basic notifications.

**Result**: Shipped in 42 days, acquired 100 users in week one, discovered users cared more about
mobile than Gantt charts (saving 3 months of wrong building).

## Now Do This

Ready to scope your MVP properly? Take these three actions in the next 48 hours:

<Checklist
  title="Your Next Steps"
  items={[
    { text: "Write your One Activation Path in 10 words or less", checked: false },
    { text: "List every feature you think you need, then cut 70%", checked: false },
    { text: "Schedule your first Friday Progress Receipt", checked: false },
  ]}
/>

The difference between shipping in 6 weeks vs 6 months isn't about working harder - it's about
building less. Use our [MVP Scope Builder](/tools/mvp-scope-builder) to create your own 1-pager in
20 minutes. For more on defining acceptance criteria that prevent rework, see our guide on
[acceptance criteria that actually work](/insights/articles/acceptance-criteria-prevent-rework).
