Traditional vendor selection fails 60% of the time because demos don't predict real-world
performance. After running 100+ pilots, we've developed a 2-week framework that reveals true
capability while protecting both parties. Here's exactly how to structure pilots that actually
predict success.

## Pilot Scope Principles That Prevent Scope Creep

The biggest pilot killer? Trying to prove everything in two weeks. Our data shows successful pilots
follow three principles:

**One Meaningful Slice**: Choose a real problem that's representative but contained. Not a toy
problem, not your hardest challenge. The "Goldilocks" problem that's just right.

**Production-Like Conditions**: No special environments or exemptions. If they can't work with your
actual constraints during the pilot, they can't work with them after.

**Measurable Success**: Define 3-5 specific outcomes that must be achieved. "Get a feel for working
together" is not measurable. "Deploy working OAuth integration" is.

<Callout type="info" title={"The 80/20 Pilot Rule"}>
  A good pilot proves 80% of critical capabilities using 20% of total project scope. If you can't
  identify that 20%, you're not ready to hire anyone.
</Callout>

## Exit Criteria and Code Ownership

Clear exit criteria prevent awkward "it's not working out" conversations. Define these before
starting:

### Technical Exit Criteria

1. **Core Functionality**: The agreed feature works end-to-end
2. **Quality Bar**: Code passes your review standards
3. **Documentation**: README sufficient for your team to maintain
4. **Performance**: Meets agreed latency/throughput targets
5. **Security**: Passes basic security scan

### Process Exit Criteria

1. **Communication**: Daily updates without prompting
2. **Velocity**: Reasonable progress each day
3. **Problem-Solving**: How they handle blockers
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Your team understands the solution
5. **Cultural Fit**: Work style matches your team

<Step number={1} title="Document Exit Criteria">
  Write specific, measurable criteria for each category. Share with vendor before starting. Both
  parties sign off.
</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Define Code Ownership">
  Pilot code belongs to you, paid or not. Include in contract: "All code, documentation, and
  artifacts created during pilot transfer to Client regardless of pilot outcome."
</Step>

<Step number={3} title="Set Go/No-Go Decision Date">
  Schedule decision for day 11. This gives you days 1-10 to evaluate, one day to decide, and time to
  communicate cleanly.
</Step>

## Observability + Daily Receipts

Visibility prevents surprises. Require these daily artifacts:

### Daily Stand-up Receipt (5 min to write)

```
Date: [Date]
Completed Today:
- [Specific deliverable with evidence]
- [Another deliverable]

Blockers:
- [Issue + proposed solution]

Tomorrow's Plan:
- [Specific commitment]

Questions:
- [Anything needs clarification]
```

### Code Commit Log

- All code in your repo (not theirs)
- Meaningful commit messages
- PR descriptions that explain why, not just what

### Metrics Dashboard

Track automatically:

- Lines of code (trending up steadily?)
- Test coverage (maintaining standards?)
- Commit frequency (daily activity?)
- PR turnaround (quick responses?)

<DoDont
  dos={[
    "Give repository access immediately",
    "Require work in your environment",
    "Review code daily, give feedback fast",
    "Track metrics automatically",
  ]}
  donts={[
    "Accept 'working on local machine'",
    "Wait until day 10 to review",
    "Skip daily check-ins to 'save time'",
    "Let them use their own tools exclusively",
  ]}
/>

## Handover Readiness Checklist

A successful pilot includes knowledge transfer. By day 10, you should have:

<Checklist
  title="Handover Requirements"
  items={[
    { text: "Working code in your repository", checked: true },
    { text: "Documentation your team can follow", checked: true },
    { text: "Test suite with >80% coverage", checked: true },
    { text: "Deployment runbook", checked: false },
    { text: "Architecture decision record", checked: false },
    { text: "List of remaining tasks with estimates", checked: false },
  ]}
/>

### The Handover Test

Have one of your developers who wasn't involved:

1. Clone the repository
2. Follow setup documentation
3. Make a small change
4. Deploy to staging

If they succeed in &lt;2 hours, handover is complete. If not, you've identified gaps before signing a
larger contract.

## Retro & Go/No-Go Decision Framework

Day 11 is decision day. Use this framework:

### Pilot Retrospective (1 hour)

**What Went Well**

- Specific achievements
- Process improvements
- Communication highlights

**What Could Improve**

- Friction points
- Unmet expectations
- Process gaps

**Key Learnings**

- About the vendor
- About your requirements
- About the project complexity

### Go/No-Go Scoring

Rate each area 1-5:

- Technical Delivery: \_\_/5
- Communication: \_\_/5
- Code Quality: \_\_/5
- Velocity: \_\_/5
- Problem Solving: \_\_/5

**Decision Rules**:

- All 4-5: Strong proceed
- Mostly 3-4: Proceed with adjustments
- Any 1-2: No-go unless critical issue

<ProsCons
  pros={[
    "See actual work quality before commitment",
    "Test communication and culture fit",
    "Reduce risk of expensive mistakes",
    "Build relationship gradually",
  ]}
  cons={[
    "Delays full project start by 2 weeks",
    "Costs more than jumping straight in",
    "Some vendors resist pilot model",
    "Limited scope may not reveal all issues",
  ]}
/>

## Real Pilot Examples

### Success Case: API Integration Vendor

**Pilot Scope**: Integrate with Salesforce and sync contacts **Daily Progress**: Steady,
communicated blockers early **Code Quality**: Excellent tests, clear documentation **Result**:
Expanded to full integration project **Key Learning**: Their Salesforce expertise saved weeks

### Failure Case: Frontend Development Shop

**Pilot Scope**: Build responsive dashboard component **Daily Progress**: Sporadic, surprise delays
**Code Quality**: No tests, poor accessibility **Result**: No-go decision on day 8 **Key Learning**:
Portfolio didn't reflect actual capability

### Mixed Case: Data Engineering Team

**Pilot Scope**: Build ETL pipeline for one data source **Daily Progress**: Good but overcomplicated
solution **Code Quality**: Solid but over-engineered **Result**: Proceeded with strict architecture
guidelines **Key Learning**: Needed clearer constraints

## Pricing Models That Work

Based on 100+ pilots, these pricing models align incentives:

### Option 1: Paid Pilot, Credit Forward

- Pilot cost: $15-25K
- If proceed: Credit toward project
- If not: Clean break, you keep code
- **Best for**: Established vendors

### Option 2: Risk-Shared Pilot

- Pilot cost: 50% of normal rate
- If proceed: Pay other 50%
- If not: Reduced cost for both parties
- **Best for**: New relationships

### Option 3: Success-Based Pilot

- No upfront cost
- Pay only if exit criteria met
- Higher project rates if proceed
- **Best for**: Confident vendors

Avoid free pilots - they attract wrong vendors and create poor incentives.

## Common Pilot Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Vague Scope** "Build something to show your skills" **Fix**: Define exact deliverable
with acceptance criteria

**Pitfall 2: Best Athlete Problem** They send their A-team for pilot, B-team for project **Fix**:
Require same team members to continue

**Pitfall 3: Extended Pilot Syndrome** "Just one more week to really prove it" **Fix**: Hard stop at
10 working days

**Pitfall 4: No-Decision Limbo** Pilot ends without clear next steps **Fix**: Pre-scheduled decision
meeting

## Your Pilot Planning Template

Use this template for your next vendor pilot:

```markdown
## Pilot Overview

Vendor: [Name] Dates: [Start] - [End] (10 working days) Decision Date: [Day 11]

## Pilot Scope

Deliverable: [Specific feature/component] Success Metrics:

1. [Measurable outcome]
2. [Another outcome]
3. [Third outcome]

## Exit Criteria

Technical:

- [ ] Core functionality works
- [ ] Passes code review
- [ ] Includes documentation
- [ ] Meets performance targets
- [ ] Security scan clean

Process:

- [ ] Daily updates received
- [ ] Blockers communicated promptly
- [ ] Knowledge transferred
- [ ] Team collaboration smooth

## Code Ownership

All artifacts transfer to us regardless of outcome

## Pricing

Model: [Paid/Risk-Shared/Success-Based] Pilot Cost: $[Amount] Credit Terms: [If applicable]

## Team

Vendor Lead: [Name] Our Lead: [Name] Required Continuity: [Same team for project]
```

## Post-Pilot Expansion Path

When pilots succeed, smooth expansion prevents momentum loss:

### Week 1 Post-Pilot

- Contract negotiation (pre-drafted)
- Team expansion planning
- Full project scoping
- Environment setup

### Week 2 Post-Pilot

- Kickoff with expanded team
- Knowledge transfer from pilot
- Establish ongoing rituals
- Begin first full sprint

Keep the same:

- Communication patterns
- Code standards
- Review cycles
- Team members (critical!)
