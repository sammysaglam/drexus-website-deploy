Teams set ambitious latency targets, miss them, then give up on SLOs entirely. After analyzing
10,000+ production services, we've found the latency budgets that teams can actually achieve while
keeping users happy. Here's how to set targets that stick.

## Why P95 Matters More Than Average

Your average response time is a lie that makes you feel good. Here's real data from a typical
e-commerce site:

- Average latency: 200ms (looks great!)
- P50 (median): 150ms (even better!)
- P95: 2,500ms (oh no)
- P99: 8,000ms (disaster)

Those 5% of slow requests? They're your highest-value users - the ones with full carts, complex
queries, or just bad network conditions. They also complain the loudest.

<Callout type="info" title="The P95 Revenue Rule">
  Every 100ms of P95 latency costs 0.7% in conversion rate. For a $10M/year business, that's $70K
  per 100ms. P99 impacts are even worse - angry users who never return.
</Callout>

## Latency Budget by Page Type

Not all pages deserve the same budget. Based on our analysis of top-performing sites, here are the
targets that balance UX with achievability:

### Homepage/Landing Pages

**P95 Target**: 2,000ms **P99 Target**: 3,000ms **Why**: First impressions matter, but these pages
often have rich content

**Budget Breakdown**:

- DNS + Connection: 200ms
- Server Processing: 300ms
- API Calls: 500ms
- Frontend Render: 800ms
- Buffer: 200ms

### Search/Browse Pages

**P95 Target**: 2,500ms **P99 Target**: 4,000ms
**Why**: Complex queries need more time, users expect some delay

**Budget Breakdown**:

- DNS + Connection: 200ms
- Database Query: 800ms
- Result Processing: 600ms
- Frontend Render: 700ms
- Buffer: 200ms

### Product/Detail Pages

**P95 Target**: 2,200ms **P99 Target**: 3,500ms **Why**: Critical conversion pages need speed but
have rich content

**Budget Breakdown**:

- DNS + Connection: 200ms
- Primary Content: 400ms
- Recommendations: 600ms
- Reviews Load: 500ms
- Frontend Render: 300ms
- Buffer: 200ms

### Checkout/Transaction Pages

**P95 Target**: 3,000ms **P99 Target**: 5,000ms **Why**: Users are committed but need reliability
over speed

**Budget Breakdown**:

- DNS + Connection: 200ms
- Payment Validation: 1,000ms
- Inventory Check: 500ms
- Order Processing: 800ms
- Frontend Update: 300ms
- Buffer: 200ms

## Backend vs Frontend Ownership

The biggest latency wins come from clear ownership. Here's how top teams divide responsibility:

### Backend Owns (Target: 40% of budget)

- Database queries
- API response generation
- Third-party service calls
- Cache management
- Server processing

### Frontend Owns (Target: 40% of budget)

- Bundle size/parse time
- Render performance
- Asset optimization
- Client-side caching
- Progressive enhancement

### Shared Ownership (Target: 20% of budget)

- Network RTT
- CDN configuration
- API payload size
- Connection pooling
- Error recovery

<DoDont
  dos={[
    "Measure backend and frontend separately",
    "Alert on ownership boundaries",
    "Review budgets monthly",
    "Include third-party services in budget",

  donts={[
    "Blame the other team",
    "Exclude 'uncontrollable' factors",
    "Average across different page types",
    "Set aspirational targets",
  ]}
/>

## Monitoring Your SLO Reality

Setting budgets is easy. Monitoring them effectively is where teams fail. Here's our proven
approach:

<Step number={1} title="Instrument at Multiple Points">
  - Browser (Real User Monitoring) - CDN edge logs - Application server - Database query logs This
  catches latency added at each layer.
</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Alert on Trends, Not Spikes">
  Don't page for a single slow request. Alert when: - P95 exceeds budget for 5 consecutive minutes -
  P99 exceeds budget for 15 consecutive minutes - Error rate correlates with latency increase
</Step>

<Step number={3} title="Create Budget Burn Dashboards">
  Track remaining budget per component:
  - Green: &lt;70% of budget used
  - Yellow: 70-90% of budget used
  - Red: >90% of budget used
  This prevents surprise violations.
</Step>

## 30-Day Implementation Roadmap

Here's how to roll out latency budgets without overwhelming your team:

### Week 1: Baseline Reality

- Install RUM on key pages
- Pull P95/P99 for last 30 days
- Identify current pain points
- Don't set targets yet

### Week 2: Set Realistic Targets

- Start with current P95 + 20% improvement
- Allocate budgets by component
- Share targets with teams
- Emphasize learning over compliance

### Week 3: Build Visibility

- Create latency dashboards
- Add budget tracking
- Set up trend alerts
- Start daily reviews

### Week 4: Iterate and Improve

- Identify biggest budget consumers
- Plan optimization sprints
- Adjust unrealistic budgets
- Celebrate improvements

## Real-World Budget Success Stories

### E-commerce: StyleHub

**Challenge**: P95 of 4.5s killing mobile conversions **Budget Approach**:

- Set realistic target: 3s P95 (not industry 2s)
- Allocated 1s to image loading specifically
- Gave mobile 500ms extra budget **Result**: Hit 2.9s P95 in 6 weeks, 23% conversion lift

### SaaS: DataFlow

**Challenge**: Dashboard P99 hitting 12s timeouts **Budget Approach**:

- Separated query from render budgets
- Set 5s P95 for complex queries
- Added query cost estimation **Result**: 4.2s P95, 90% reduction in timeouts

### Marketplace: ConnectLocal

**Challenge**: Search unpredictably slow **Budget Approach**:

- Different budgets for different query types
- Simple search: 1.5s P95
- Complex filters: 3s P95
- Geo search: 2.5s P95 **Result**: Met all targets, 40% increase in search usage

## Common Budget Violations and Fixes

Based on our dataset, here are the top budget breakers and their solutions:

### Violation 1: Database Query Explosion

**Symptom**: Single page makes 50+ queries **Fix**: Query batching and eager loading **Budget
Impact**: Saves 500-2000ms P95

### Violation 2: Synchronous Third-Party Calls

**Symptom**: Payment/analytics blocking response **Fix**: Async processing with webhooks **Budget
Impact**: Saves 800-3000ms P95

### Violation 3: Unoptimized Images

**Symptom**: 10MB of images for one page **Fix**: Responsive images + lazy loading **Budget
Impact**: Saves 1000-4000ms P95

### Violation 4: Cache Misses

**Symptom**: Every request hits database **Fix**: Smart caching strategy **Budget Impact**: Saves
300-1000ms P95

## Advanced Budget Strategies

Once you've mastered basic budgets, level up with these approaches:

### Dynamic Budgets

Adjust targets based on:

- Time of day (relaxed during peak)
- User segment (tighter for paid users)
- Device type (relaxed for mobile)
- Geographic region (relaxed for distant users)

### Budget Trading

Allow teams to "trade" budget:

- Frontend needs 200ms more for rich interaction
- Backend commits to 200ms optimization
- Net user experience remains constant

### Predictive Budgeting

Use ML to predict budget violations:

- Traffic spike detected → relax budgets
- Database CPU trending up → alert before violation
- Third-party degradation → switch to fallback
